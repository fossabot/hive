Hello,

I’m Karim, a student developer based in Paris and I’m currently looking for a team and a new project. I don’t apply often since I’m working on an open source project. I’m very enthusiastic about your offer and I feel the full stack developer position suits my skills.

I’m working on a daily basis with Go, gRPC, React (16.8). I also used GraphQL+- with the Dgraph database once. Lately, I started working on micro-services architecture with gRPC. So I build a CLI tool, written in Go, in order to get a more friendly deployment of microservices, manage a global architecture, standardise services structures, and a lot more. I’m very passionate by these technologies and I would be very happy to share my passion with colleagues. This position is a great opportunity, as I never seen a similar use of this stack in France.

On the other side, I’m very aware about alternatives living mode: I’ve been a digital nomad, living in shared flat many years, not for an economic reason but because I appreciate community living. Before learning programming I was planning to join in a participatory housing program and I still dream of it. Your concept seems similar with some unique specificities. I understand your business model and some problematics you’re facing. As I could be one of your client, I also understand customer’s needs. Indeed peoples need other way of living and I will be happy to contribute to this great project.

Since I’m a not a senior developer I want to make a proposal: in order to confirm my skills and motivation, I could start as a freelance with a negotiable daily rate (TJM).

My expectations are:
Joining a project,
Enjoying team’s work,
Working on a substantial project,
Building new tools,
Learning from mentors, I watched Maxime’s video, I would be very happy to share more insights with him.
If you’re interested in my profile, we can meet or have a call at any time.
